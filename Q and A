Q:  What is the use of SQLite open helper class in SQLite?
Answer:

•	The android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper class is used for database creation and version management. 
•	For performing any database operation, we need to provide the implementation of onCreate() and onUpgrade() 
        methods of SQLiteOpenHelper class.
        
        
        
Q:  What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?
Answer:

•	onUpgrade is basically for handling new database which could be new column addition,table addition for
        any new version of your app.The onUpgrade() method will only be called when the version integer is larger than
        the current version running in the emulator.If you want the onUpgrade() method to be called, you need to increment
        the version number in your code
         
•	Dropping table is always not necessary in onUpgrade. It all depends on the requirement.
